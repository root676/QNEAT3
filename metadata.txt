description=QNEAT3 - QGIS Network Analysis Toolbox 3 
about=The QNEAT3 (short for Qgis Network Analysis Toolbox 3) Plugin aims to provide sophisticated QGIS Processing-Toolbox algorithms in the field of network analysis. QNEAT3 is integrated in the QGIS3 Processing Framework. It offers algorithms that range from simple shortest path solving to more complex tasks like Iso-Area (aka service areas, accessibility polygons) and OD-Matrix (Origin-Destination-Matrix) computation. The usage of some Iso-Area algorithms require the installation of the matplotlib python library from OSGeo4W (see algorithm and help page for more information).

	1.0.4:
	- Fix bug #25 Wire tolerance parameter permanently to QgsGraphBuilder
    1.0.5:
    - New Feature: allow output of route geometry from OD Matrix algorithms (thanks to @garci66)
    - Fix issue #26: report NULL or delete OD pairs with no routes
    - Fix issue #57: Current processing setup does not allow qgis_process (CLI) to access QNEAT3 (thanks to @JanCaha)
    - Fix issue #62: API break in wkbType() (thanks to @merkato)
    - Fix issue #29: fix analysis crs in contours and interpolation algorithms (thanks to @kufreu and @josephholler)
    - fix issue #36: OD Matrix miscalculates time cost if network CRS does not use linear units of meters (thanks to @kufreu and @josephholler)
    - fix issue #31: Allow for different origin and destination ID data types (thanks to @kufreu and @josephholler)
